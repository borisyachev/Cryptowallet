# Cryptowallet


Cryptowallet is a Java console application which acts as a trading cryptocurrency simulator. Many users can be joined to the server simultaniously and use the server functionalities which are buying assets, selling assets, getting real-time information about the current prices of the assets (limited to 50 in the current code), getting information about their wallet information (amount of each asset, current price of the asset, money deposited in the wallet) and also a total amount of money in their wallet if they sell all of their assets at the current moment (based on the price they have bought each and every one of them).
